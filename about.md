Thanks for stopping by. My name is Tony Distinti. I'm a former tax lawyer turned full-stack web developer.

I love tinkering, particularly on the computer and in the kitchen. Generous knowledge sharing on the internet has been a great help to my tinkering habits over the years, and this blog attempts to give back by offering lessons I've learned while in front of the keyboard or the stovetop. And a few posts may be just for fun.

Where does the title [Bread / Olive Oil / Salt](../) come from? Give me those three things and another person to share the table with, and I'm very happy.

Hope you enjoy what you come across here and find it helpful.
